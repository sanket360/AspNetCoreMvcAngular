This article shows how Angular can be run inside an ASP.NET Core MVC view using Webpack to build the Angular application. By using Webpack, the Angular application can be built using the AOT and Angular lazy loading features and also profit from the advantages of using a server side rendered view. If you prefer to separate the SPA and the server into 2 applications, use Angular CLI or a similiar template.
